Simple model to estimate prevalence of COVID-19 on BT busses

## Assumptions
1. Prevalence among the population is about 2% (about the same as noticed in a similar population of UVA football players returning to campus)
2. The number of passengers of each bus follows a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 20
3. Passengers of each busride are indepedent
